# EncryptedDatabase
Final Python Project:

Create a tool that will encrypt certain files in a database.
The files will be stored on a disk encrypted in a specific location and the file data / the encryption method and so on will be kept in a database.
The tool will allow you to add a file to the database, read a file from the database as well as deleting a file from the database
Only solutions that use asymmetric encryption are accepted.
You are not allowed to use existing tools.

INPUT:
The file to be added / read / deleted

OUTPUT:
Output of run orders.
Careful! When a file is read from the encrypted database - the tool will display
decrypted content
